## 4 bigger categories of TWO-POINTER
Marked the typical example problems with (*)
### 1. Running from both ends of an array(swap l++, r--)
##### Case1- One slow-runner and the other fast-runner. Eg-1 (while(r less n) If condition right r+=1 else l+=1 update num[l] return l or l+1). 
##### Case2- One pointer starts from the beginning while the other pointer starts from the end. Eg-3 Swap l++, r- - ;

### 2. Slow & Fast Pointers (while r less n if cond T r+=1 else l+=1 update num[l] return l or l+1)
Next type is using two pointers with different speed of movement. Typically they starts from the left end, then the first pointer advances fast and give some feedback to the slow pointer and do some calculation.

### 4. Split & Merge of an array / Divide & Conquer
The last one is similiar to previous category but there is one thing is added. First, you need to split the given list into 2 separate lists and then do two pointers approach to merge or unify them. There aren't many tasks here.

* #### Partition
1. (*) (https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)

* #### Sorting
1. (*) (https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)
